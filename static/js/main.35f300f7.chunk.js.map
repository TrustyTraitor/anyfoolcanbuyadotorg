This website is proof of that. I first bought this webdomain when I was 17 and it costs me just $12 a year.\r\n                    .com .net and .org are all examples of what are known as \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Top Level Domains.</a>\" \r\n                    There are hundreds of TLD and most of them are unrestricted to who can use them. Some examples of restricted TLD's are .gov and .edu.\r\n                    Websites such as <a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://domains.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n                    Google Domains</a> makes it very easy to buy a web domain.

Wikipedia is a great starting point but it should never be sited as a source. \r\n                    The best way to use Wikipedia is to go to the sources at the bottom of the page. The issue with Wikipedia is that it is \r\n                    another layer removed from the source. This will introduce bias into the writing intentional or not. You also know nothing about \r\n                    who edited that page, and Wikipedia pages are notorious for being edited by internet trolls. A great way to think about Wikipedia \r\n                    is like a game of telephone. Each person passes along what they think the other person said but it will be distorted and lose accuracy along the way.</p>\r\n                \r\n                    <p className=\"qa\">Q: Does having a degree automatically make someone right?</p>\r\n                    <p><span className=\"qa\">A:</span> No, it does not. There are many people who have degrees who are still incredibly wrong.\r\n                    When verifying information from any source, you should always find multiple sources that agree. It is also important to \r\n                    remember that there can be multiple academics with similar incorrect views. It is best to find what the consensus is among the \r\n                    larger scientific community and find out why the smaller group holds an opposing view.</p>\r\n\r\n                    <hr/>\r\n                \r\n                    <h5>So, we've covered some common misconceptions, now onto what you should be doing. </h5>\r\n                    <p className=\"qa\">Always find primary sources.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        Like mentioned in the Wikipedia question, every degree of seperation information \r\n                        has from its source will introduce bias. The best information you can get is from the source.\r\n                        Primary information should have the least amount of bias because it has not been edited \r\n                        by dozens of people unaffiliated with the original information.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p className=\"qa\">Always question an authors biases.</p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                        While a primary source is always best, everyone has bias. Most research papers \r\n                        will include a section about the researchers biases and what steps they took to \r\n                        remove them from the research. This is an invaluable tool when finding a reliable source.\r\n                    </p>\r\n\r\n                    <p className=\"qa\">Find papers through scholarly databases and journals</p>\r\n                    <p>A great place to do research is sites such as <a rel=\"noreferrer\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Scholar</a> (more below) \r\n                    These sites have thousands of articles or links to other accredited journals.

Most authors do not get paid for each sale of their \r\n                    research so they will be more than happy to pass it along for free.</p>\r\n                </CustomJumbotron>\r\n                <CustomJumbotron header=\"Scholarly databases and Journals\">\r\n\r\n                </CustomJumbotron>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default Home;","function About() {\r\n    \r\n    return (\r\n        <div className=\"About\">\r\n            About\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/favicon.daf389bf.svg\";","import {Link} from 'react-router-dom';\r\nimport {Navbar, Nav, Container} from 'react-bootstrap';\r\nimport BrandLogo from '../Assets/favicon.svg';\r\nimport '../Styles/Navigation.scss';\r\n\r\nfunction Navigation() {\r\n    \r\n    return (\r\n        <Navbar collapseOnSelect expand=\"lg\" sticky=\"top\">\r\n            <Container fluid>\r\n                <Navbar.Toggle/>\r\n                <Link to=\"/\" className=\"navbar-brand mx-3 d-sm-block d-md-block d-lg-none\"><img src={BrandLogo} alt=\"ORG\" className=\"navbarLogo\"/></Link>\r\n                <Navbar.Collapse id=\"responsive-navbar-nav\" className=\"justify-content-center\">\r\n                    <Nav>\r\n                        <Link to=\"/\" className=\"nav-link navbarLinks\">Home</Link>\r\n                        <Link to=\"/\" className=\"navbar-brand mx-3 d-none d-lg-block\"><img src={BrandLogo} alt=\"ORG\" className=\"navbarLogo\"/></Link>\r\n                        <Link to=\"/About\" className=\"nav-link navbarLinks\">About</Link>\r\n                    </Nav>\r\n                </Navbar.Collapse>\r\n            </Container>\r\n        </Navbar>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Navigation;","import React from 'react';\nimport {HashRouter as Router, Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom'\nimport Home from './Pages/Home';\nimport About from './Pages/About';\nimport Navigation from './components/Navigation';\n\nimport './App.scss'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n        <Router>\n            <Navigation/> \n\n            <Switch>\n                <Route path=\"/\" exact component={Home}/>\n                <Route path=\"/About\" exact component={About}/>\n            </Switch>\n        </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","import { ReportHandler } from 'web-vitals';\n\nconst reportWebVitals = (onPerfEntry?: ReportHandler) => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
